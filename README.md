# Campussim: An agent-based epidemic simulator for campuses

CampusSim is an agent-based simulator that models the disease's spread via various interaction spaces on the campus. It generates an interaction graph between agents and interaction spaces. Agents are assigned different interactions spaces such as classrooms, hostels, messes, and cafeterias. CampusSim is a parsimonious model that enables a fast and concise simulation of the epidemic spread. The simulator models intervention strategies (case isolation, hostel quarantine, etc.) and users can also define their own, custom interventions to simulate. The simulator is a derivative based out of the [IISc-TIFR City-Scale simulator](https://github.com/cni-iisc/epidemic-simulator). 

This project is carried out by the Centre for Networked Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and is funded as part of the Campus Rakshak project by the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India.

## Quick start

For ease-of-use there is a single shell script which can be used to test the campus-simulator, called `run_sims.sh`.
The script instatiates an example sample campus, compiles the simulator's executable, runs the simulator and makes the plots from the different statistics

```shell
bash run_sims.sh or ./run_sims.sh
```

This shell script will run the simulator 10 times by default.

## Documentation
Detailed instructions to instantiate campuses is available at [staticInst/README.md](#)
Detailed instructions to run the simulator is available at [cpp-simulator/README.md](#)
Detailed instructions to calibrate the simulator is available at [calibrate_betas/README.md](#)

`visualization/` has a script to generate the plots

Use the following command to run the plotting script:
`python3 campus_plotting.py`

## How to Run Campus Rakshak Simulator from the Terminal

1. If one wants to run the campus simulator through their terminal, the following tips will help:

2. Clone the repository from the Github link provided in the email.

3. You can find the required python packages in requirements.txt. Install them before you run the script.

4. Parse and instantiate runs with the default input directory being staticInst/data/campus_sample_data. You can either specify the input directory while running the command or transfer your custom csvs to the above folder before you run the script.

5. The default intervention parameters json is intervention_params.json found in staticInst/data/campus_data which can be modified to run the intervention that you desire. You can also create your own intervention file, store it in the above folder and specify the intervention file in the command to run the simulator script. An intervention file’s format for a basic intervention is given below:
[
	{
		“num_days”: <any positive integer>,
		“compliance”: <value between 0 and 1>,
		“<name of the intervention>”:
		{
			“active”: true
		}
	}
]
For no intervention, the last field is unnessecary.

The default testing protocol json is testing_protocol_001.json found in staticInst/data/campus_data which can be modified to run the testing protocol that you desire. You can also create your own testing protocol file, store it in the above folder and specify the testing protocol file in the command to run the simulator script. The format for a testing protocol file is the exact same as that in testing_protocol_001.json and the only changes that need to be made are the values. With the exception of testing capacity which is a positive integer, every other value lies between 0 and 1.

6. The commands for both Parse and Instantiate and the Campus Simulator are provided in the READMEs in the Github repository.

7. To get a holistic view of the simulator’s results, it is best to first run the shell command provided above for each basic intervention -- No Intervention, Case Isolation, Class Isolation, Lockdown, Selective Shutdown, and Evacuation -- that consolidates 10 runs of the simulator.

8. The plots will be generated by going to the visualization and running the campus_plotting.py script. You can find the plots in staticInst/data/campus_outputs/plots_data/.

NOTE: The campus simulator has been tested extensively with GNU on a linux/mac os terminal, it might be preferable to run the simulator on those terminals.
