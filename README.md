## Campus Simulator

This repository contains the source code for the epidemic spread modelling simulation framework for campuses. The simulator is the adaptation of the [IISc-TIFR City-Scale simulator](https://github.com/cni-iisc/epidemic-simulator). 

The campus simulator also has a web-application which will be made available soon.

Instructions to instantiate campuses and run the simulator will be added soon.
